Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out!

It appears the Trial checkout was completed and terminated. Then you completed an outright purchase of Pro. My apologies for any confusion regarding this matter. Per your description, it sounds like you've signed up for the Pro subscription without realizing the trial was free. I've canceled your current subscription and refunded you for the last charge on the account. You should see the return credit on your account within 3-5 business days, depending on your bank's processing speeds.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Allyn
